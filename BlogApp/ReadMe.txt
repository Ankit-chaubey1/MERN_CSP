📝 Project Overview: Basic Blog API with MongoDB
This is a basic-level Node.js and Express-based blog API project connected to MongoDB. The primary functionalities currently implemented are:

✅ POST Request: Users can create and post blogs.

✅ GET Request: All blogs can be retrieved using a GET request.

You can test these endpoints using Postman or any other API testing tool.

🔒 Authentication & Authorization (Coming Soon):
I'm actively working on implementing user authentication so that:

Each user will be able to register and log in.

A user will have access to CRUD operations on their own blogs only.
